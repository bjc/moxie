    <h1>What's new</h1>
    <h3>Since 0.4</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A timer hook now fires every second. You can attach to it by adding
	a function to <code>:timer-hook</code>.</li>
      <li>Telnet DONT and WONT are handled properly now.</li>
      <li>The lisp image includes ASDF and CL-PPCRE, so startup times should be faster
        if you use CL-PPCRE in your plugins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Since 0.3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>ANSI color support is now supplied via a built-in plug in.</li>
      <li>You can send a lone enter key press.</li>
      <li>Telnet protocol support.</li>
      <li>You can clear your screen from the plug in interface now. For convenience,
        the command "/clear" will clear your screen, as well as the <code>clear</code>
	key on the numeric keypad.</li>
      <li>Numpad keybindings have been added via a plug in.</li>
      <li>Hooks use the results of the previous hook in a mode if applicable now, to
        allow for multiple levels of filter feeding off of each other. This does complicate
        things a little more, but it also allows hooks to play nice with each other.</li>
      <li>Hooks no longer set arbitrary keywords. Those have been replaced by special
	variables which will do the right thing, and greatly simplify plugin code.</li>
      <li>Attributed strings changed. You can now set multiple attributes across multiple
	ranges of the string.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Since 0.2:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Moxie now scans for plugins in ~/Library/Moxie, and the usual variations
	thereof for Network, Local, and System directories.</li>
      <li>There's a new package, CLHS-LOOKUP, which will lookup symbols in the CLHS.</li>
      <li>The world view is no longer cleared when reconnecting.</li>
      <li>Lisp is now initialized at startup time.</li>
      <li>The Lisp system is no longer embedded. You can use any CL system you wish
	now. The communications channels have become asynchronous, as well. The lisp
	system should never hang Moxie again, although it is still required for its
        functioning. You can now also use the built-in debugging features of whichever
        lisp you choose.</li>
      <li>CLISP is now included as the default lisp implementation. You can get more
	information on CLISP at <a href="http://clisp.cons.org/">the website.</a></li>
      <li>Logging has been moved into a plugin. You can now enable and disable it
	from within plugins, and for convenience, the command "/log [filename]" in
	a Moxie window will enable logging to FILENAME, if it exists, otherwise it
	will toggle logging to the current log file.</li>
      <li>The plug in system now defines "keystroke macros" which run when individual
	keys are pressed. See the plug in documentation for further details.</li>
      <li>Logging can be enabled and disabled from the plug in system.</li>
      <li>The status buffer (the text field next to the lag indicator) can now
	be set from the plug in system.</li>
      <li>World-local variables are now available in the plug in system via the
	<code>world-var</code> function. These variables differ depending upon
        which world is calling into the plug in, and can be used to keep state
        information. See the plug in documentation for further information.</li>
      <li>CL-PPCRE moved into the PlugIns directory.</li>
      <li>Plug in documentation updated for all exported functions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Since 0.1:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Plugin System is here. The plugins are written in Lisp thanks to
	<a href="http://ecls.sourceforge.net/" target="new">ECL.</a>
	<a href="http://www.cliki.net/asdf" target="new">ASDF</a> and
	<a href="http://www.cliki.net/cl-ppcre" target="new">CL-PPCRE</a> are
	also included. See the help file for details.</li>

      <li>Help is now available in the standard place. It's pretty empty at
	the moment, but includes some pointers on how to get started with the
	plugin system. There is also a sample plugin provided in the application
        bundle, in the "PlugIns" directory.</li>
    </ul>
