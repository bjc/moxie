    <h1>Known Bugs</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>The world selector will not raise the window you select if it's already the frontmost
        Moxie window, even if Moxie is in the background (it comes next-to-top, for reasons I don't
        at all understand).</li>
      <li>Fonts get screwed up fairly frequently, especially when trying to set them via the font panel.</li>
      <li>The "Choose" button for choosing the REPL font doesn't work at all.</li>
      <li>Reading from standard-input in Lisp will hang Moxie.</li>
    </ul>
