    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Moxie is a client for <a href="glossary.html#mux">MUX</a> systems. Some of its
      notable features are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ANSI color support is supplied via a plug in.</li>
      <li>It has trigger, alias, and macro support via the <a href="plugin.html">plugin</a> sub-system.</li>
      <li>Lisp-based plugin system, instead of a custom scripting language, so you can write
	any kind of plug in you can imagine.</li>
      <li>Transparent windows.</li>
      <li>Command History via the CMD-Up/Down arrows. This also works in the Lisp REPL.</li>
      <li>MUX-formatted pasting, which translates whitespace to %r, %t, %b as appropriate.</li>
      <li>Auto-login to servers.</li>
      <li>Startup worlds allow you to auto-open worlds when Moxie starts up.</li>
      <li>Logging of sessions to plain-text files.</li>
      <li>An innovative "World Selector" which allows you to switch between worlds very
	quickly, shows status (New Activity, Connected, Disconnected), allowing for:</li>
      <li>Clean and simple tab-less design, hearkening back to older MacOS days.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can create sessions ("<a href="glossary.html#world">Worlds</a>" in Moxie)
      which contain all your preferences for a given world, as well as configure
      global preferences (such as what worlds to start up when Moxie launches).</p>
